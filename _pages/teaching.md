I’ve supported/led modules in molecular biology and bioinformatics (LLNL, CSU, etc.). Example topics:

- **Intro to QIIME 2** (amplicon workflows, stats)
- **Reproducible pipelines** (Snakemake on SLURM)
- **Metagenome assembly & binning** (MEGAHIT/SPAdes → MAGs → DRAM)
- **Modeling SIP data** (from naive approaches to BHMs)

_Open to guest lectures and workshops._
