### SIP/qSIP + Bayesian Hierarchical Models
Short blurb on your model structure and goals (ASV‑level incorporation; moisture/time effects; uncertainty).  
**Links:** [preprint/paper](), [slides](), [code repo]().

### Genome‑resolved metagenomics + metatranscriptomics (MAG‑centric)
How you normalize (GeTMM; length/size) and how you analyze activity vs abundance.  
**Links:** [methods](), [datasets](), [workflow]().
