Hi — I’m **Ikaia (Kai) Leleiwi**, a postdoctoral researcher at **LLNL** focused on using **omics** and **stable-isotope probing (SIP/qSIP)** to understand **soil microbiomes** and their contributions to global biogeochemical cycling. I build reproducible pipelines on HPC infrastructure to process and analyze multi-omics data. I'm particularly interested in using **Bayesian hierarchical models** and machine learning to quantify microbial activity and uncertainty to draw new infrence and discover complex relationships between microbes and their environment.

## What I work on (right now)
- **qSIP + BHM:** MAG-level isotope incorporation with moisture/time effects and explicit uncertainty.
- **MAG-centric meta-omics:** Joint analysis of qSIP metagenomics + metatranscriptomics to compare SIP activity to transcriptional acitivty.
- **Genome annotation and mapping at scale:** DRAM/Barrnap/dbCAN/FeGenie/Bowtie2/CoverM/HTSeq workflows that remain robust under many samples on SLURM.

> I’m open to collaborations on SIP/qSIP modeling, MAG-centric activity inference, and scalable meta-omics agnostic to enviorment.  
> _If it touches Bayesian inference or machine learning + HPC, I’m interested._

## Tools I like
`R (tidymodels, brms)` · `Python` · `Rust` · `Snakemake` · `QIIME 2` · `SLURM` · `MEGAHIT/SPAdes` · `DRAM` · `barrnap`


## Personal Hobbies
- I'm a huge movie buff (though I've found TV has been better recently)! I read sci-fi and fantasy books and my family and I frequent Denver FanExpo every year (we dressed as Naruto characters this year).
- I like camping in the beautiful Rocky Mountains and spending time with my wife and two sons.
